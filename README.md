# BlockProject2
This project aims to validate the security of passwords inputted by the user. 

This file aims to check that a password is acceptable given common password criteria. 
The main password criteria are that the password must be longer than 8 characters, the password must have a capital letter, a number, and a special character. 
Additionally, the password cannot contain any popular, easy-to-guess password. Since I am using the Apache, open source license, People will be able to add any popular passwords that are a security risk. 

My reasoning for choosing an Apache license is because I am not the most adept developer and I am not a security expert. By making this program open source, other people will be able to improve on my initial
contributions to this project to make an improve product for everybody. My biggest goal is to make a tool that is the most functional for protecting people in terms of password security. I do not want to make it proprietary because I want to contribute something for "the greater good".
